Down the lane 3 years what do you want to be ?

you can also say:

What Technical Difficulties you faced as a QA test engineer?
While i was doing manual testing, i faced a issue of time constraint and then when coming to automation, we had issue with Selenium captacha, bar code automation. 
So, there as i was the only Sr Qa in my team who had to deal with this i have learnt third party tool called auto it and automated it by giving its path. 
--I also dealt with Ajax request , for synchroniation which i resolved by using waits and giving conditions. 

What architecture you used?
We used Hybrid approach, we used data driven, key drivena and page object model. 
For appliction, we use n-tier , 3-tier we used. 
It had Web layer( jsp), business logic layer and back end.
(Describe relating to your project about 3 tier or n-tier)
